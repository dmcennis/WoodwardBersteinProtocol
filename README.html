    This software is meant to be a starting place for a distributed news system to encourage and protect citizen
    participation in the news making process.  It encourages and enforces a clear distinction between sources
    (private or anonymous) and journalists (publicly associated with their stories) for the protection of those
    that participate.  I hope you find it useful. - Daniel McEnnis
